The image is not from the latest version, but should give you an idea of what it looks like.

This extruder holds two 60ml syringes. It is based on the paste extruder from printrbot (https://www.youmagine.com/designs/printrbot-paste-extruder-beta).
This version is explanded to hold two syringes instead of one. It can be used with a normal Nema17 or a Nema17 with a gear reduction.

## Bill of materials
- Lasercut parts
- 3D printed parts
- leadscrew (use a leadscrew with a smaller pitch for more torque on the syringes)
- leadscrew nut (that works with your leadscrew)
- nema17 (with gear reduction)
- motor coupler (5mm to 8mm)
- some m3 nuts and bolts.

If you have any questions regarding the design, feel free to shoot me a message.
